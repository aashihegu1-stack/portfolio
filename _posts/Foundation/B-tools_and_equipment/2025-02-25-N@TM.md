Feel free to add schedules, links, or lecture notes here.

## Night at the Museum

At N@TM I saw all of the computer science classes (CSSE, AP CSP, and AP CSA) showcase their major achievements this trimester and talk about how they worked. A lot of the AP CSP projects were advanced games or interactive courses—Brie’s group, for example, built a full course teaching. The AP CSA booths all seemed connected to CSSE’s work; Xavier’s team helped develop the gamebuilder we used for our RPG, which I thought was really cool.

### Presenting our class game

Our class displayed the RPG we’d been building, showing whatever parts were functional. I did the walkthrough on the back TV while visitors tried the game themselves. We talked about sprites, code, NPCs, and the overall design. We also handed out a feedback form; as expected, most people suggested the mechanics could be deeper.

### Night at the Museum photos

Below are the pictures I took during the event. They’ve been moved into the `images/foundation` folder so they’ll render properly:
